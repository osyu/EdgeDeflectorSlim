# EdgeDeflectorSlim
A small application to redirect calls for the Edge URI protocol (e.g. from Cortana/Search or help buttons) to the default browser instead of Microsoft Edge.

This is functionally identical to [da2x's EdgeDeflector](https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector), except much smaller and faster (built to a native assembly rather than using .NET Framework).

## Installation
1. Run the latest installer available from [releases](https://github.com/osyu/EdgeDeflectorSlim/releases).
2. After running, you will be prompted to associate EdgeDeflectorSlim with the `microsoft-edge` URI protocol. This can be set in Windows settings: `Apps > Default apps > Choose default apps by protocol`.
